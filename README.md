Yield or Die! Train yourself to learn rules for right-of-way, 
without spending lots of money for practice at driving school!

That said, the author personally used this software to efficiently practice,
and is now the proud owner of a driver's license (4th time was the charm).

The rules were written for Romania, but they are probably very similar 
for many jurisdictions. Romania has ratified the [Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Convention_on_Road_Signs_and_Signals).

I would greatly appreciate confirmation from various countries!

The implemented rules are:

1. If there are no other cars that would intersect your path, you must go through.
2. If you are the only one with a right-of-way/priority sign, you must go through first.
3. If the other cars have a yield sign and you don't, then you must also go through first.
4. If everyone has the same level of right-of-way, then you must yield to the vehicle coming from your right, if there is one.
  - There are two kinds of "coming from your right":
    - before you enter the intersection, the car is on the road to your right
    - after you enter the intersection, you would turn left (and a car is coming from the road ahead or from the right). This way, if you were to go left, the other car coming from ahead (North) would hit your right.
5. If you are opposite of someone and both of you want to turn left, in this game you must yield. In practice though, you might be able to go through if both of you keep left of the intersection's center. But I didn't want to code this in the game, and I wouldn't do it in reality either.

I appreciate contributions, especially for inclusion in [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/).

# Development

You need Kivy, Buildozer, and JDK.

- Install OS dependencies first
    - For Arch Linux these are: `sudo pacman -Sy android-tools sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_mixer sdl2_ttf`

- Then Python dependencies; rebuilds Kivy because of audio bug in Pip binary
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

After you install the dependencies, you can run using:

`python main.py`

But the project is more fun on (and designed for) a mobile phone. Read further.

# Android

## You need JDK

Android requires JDK and Gradle.

On Arch Linux, you can try:
    sudo pacman -Sy jdk-openjdk gradle


## Deploy on Android

To deploy on Android, you need `adb` and other tools in the Android SDK.

After changing `buildozer.spec` or your Java installation, you probably need to run:

    buildozer appclean

To show devices:

    adb devices

Check that the device is visible (search for the error if you do not see similar output):

    List of devices attached
    6b7fa94 device

Finally, deploy to the device:

    buildozer android debug deploy run

This will take a while the first time; Buildozer has a lot of dependencies,
including the Android SDK for which there are two (??) license agreements.

On my 6-year-old laptop it took 30 minutes.

Compilation will use CPU; make sure you have adequate cooling and/or thermal throttling.

A built APK file will be available in `yield-or-die/.buildozer/android/platform/build-armeabi-v7a/dists/yield_or_die/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.

## Regenerating images

If you edit the graphics, you need to generate PNGs from the SVGs,
because Kivy does not support SVG, but SVG has superior editability for the style.

This requires commands from the `imagemagick` package: `mogrify` and `convert`.
To perform it:

    cd pics/
    ./generate_pngs.sh
    

Because the vast majority of people will not edit the graphics,
the PNGs are in the Git repo as well (whole project is under 3MB anyway).

Alternatively you can edit the PNGs directly.
